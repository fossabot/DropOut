    // Default depends on the first rule theoretically, but usually "allow" if no "disallow" matches?
    // Actually MC logic: implicit disallow? No, implicit allow usually?
    // Official launcher Rule logic:
    // "Libraries are allowed unless restricted by a rule."
    // Actually detailed logic:
    // Check all rules. if action is "allow" and condition matches, allowed = true.
    // if action is "disallow" and condition matches, allowed = false.
    // Typically base state is false if rules exist? No.
    // Let's check common pattern.
    // Usually: [ {action: allow}, {action: disallow, os: "osx"} ]
    // This implies base allowed, but OS X disallowed.
    // Pattern 2: [ {action: allow, os: "osx"} ]
    // This implies ONLY osx allowed?

    // Correct logic:
    // If rules are present, start with result = false (deny all).
    // Loop through rules. If a rule applies (os matches), update result to (action == "allow").
    // Wait, let's verify.
    // If the list is [ {action: allow} ], result becomes true.
    // If list is [ {action: allow}, {action: disallow, os: "osx"} ].
    // On Linux: Rule 1 matches -> true. Rule 2 (osx) doesn't match -> ignore. Final: true.
    // On OSX: Rule 1 matches -> true. Rule 2 matches -> false. Final: false.

    // So: Start false. Apply rules in order.
